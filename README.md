# TeachMeSkills_C32_HW_Lesson_20

## The following is implemented:
- Task 1
  Create a program that simulates the morning: reading news, having breakfast, and coffee. Assign a name and priority to each thread from a config file. There should be 3 threads. Create and start 3 threads. Make two versions: one using the Runnable interface and/or using the Thread class.
- Task 2
  There is a car service station (CSS). The CSS can service a maximum number of cars at a time. Create a class that will run in a separate thread and will add cars for servicing in the CSS. Create a class that will run in a separate thread and will pick up the repaired cars from the CSS. The maximum number of available cars for servicing should be defined in an interface that stores constants. Use synchronized, wait, and notify.
